# html_rubicks_cube

This repository contains a simple interactive Rubik's Cube implemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Usage

* **Rotate the entire cube** – click and hold the mouse (or touch and drag) anywhere on the screen and move the pointer. The cube will follow the drag direction.
* **Rotate a face** – double‑click (or double‑tap) on any visible square of the face you want to turn. The corresponding layer will rotate 90°.

After each move you can continue dragging to view the cube from another angle or double‑click another face to rotate a different layer.

The cube uses modern CSS3 features, so a modern browser is required.
