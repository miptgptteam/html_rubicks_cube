# html_rubicks_cube

This repository contains a simple interactive Rubik's Cube implemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Usage

- **Rotate the cube** – click and drag anywhere inside the page.
- **Rotate a face** – double‑click on any facelet (a colored square). The entire layer behind that face will turn.

The rotations animate and stack, so you can scramble and solve the cube directly in the browser.

## How to view via GitHub Pages

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account (or use your copy).
2. In the repository settings on GitHub, find the **Pages** section.
3. Set the source branch to `main` (or the default branch) and the folder to `/root`.
4. Save the settings. After a minute, your site will be available at:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`
5. Open that URL in your browser to see `index.html` running.

The cube uses modern CSS3 features, so a modern browser is required.
